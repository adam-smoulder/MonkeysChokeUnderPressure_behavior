%% This script wraps the count-by-cond-from-behavior function. We use 
%  this to consolidate some of the failure methods based on the analyses
%  that we're doing. This script specifically is for the figures of the
%  main paper, where:
%  - quitouts and misstarts (no real trial) are excluded ([-20 -13 -14 0] = 0)
%  - No attempts, wild, and early returns are also removed due to infrequency ([-21 -26 -33] = 0)
%  - the few -111s we have are misstarts (-111 = 0)
%  - we'll remove any excluded trials (0s removed)
%  - overshoots = targ hold overshoots = scuff ([-22 -32 -31] = -22)
%       - -22 indicates that the animal reached past the center of the
%       reach target without entering
%       - -32 indicates that the animal entered the reach target and exited
%       the far side of it, effectively "blowing through" the target
%       - -31 is a "scuff", where the inside of the reach target is kinda
%       grazed. These are more overshoot-y than undershoot-y
%  - undershoots = slow ([-23 -24 -25] = -23)
%       - -23 = reach landed outside of the target, not enough time for a
%       corrective movement
%       - -24 = so slow of a reaction/start that there's basically no way
%       they were going to make it
%       - -25 = could've made it with a fast enough reach, but were still
%       too slow
%  - target hold failures = jitter also ([-34 -35] = -34)
%       - -34 = target hold drift, hand landed well in target but falls out
%       - -35 = "jitter" - hand landed juuuust inside the target edge, but
%       natural-looking hand jitter causes the cursor to leave = fail
% Assumes that behavior_bySubject is in the workspace, along with nsubjects
% and subjectNames
