%%% This script makes the figure showing performance for sessions where a
%%% "common-jackpot" cue was present; it showed up with the same frequency
%%% as S/M/L, but had the same magnitude as Jackpot, answering the question
%%% "can reward magnitude alone explain the performance drop that we see in 
%%% the main task?" - the answer is nah, though there might be a slight
%%% drop (though statistically insignificant).
%%%
%%% This one is actually very interesting for two reasons:
%%% 1) It means that in our setup, we need the rarity to provide enough
%%% pressure to induce choking. If he gets Jackpots willy-nilly, choking
%%% isn't consistent nor nearly as strong as with rare jackpots
%%% 2) He STILL choked for the normal (rare) Jackpots even with the
%%% Common-jackpots present. This is odd in the sense that they're worth
%%% equal amounts, just one happens to be rarer. So why is he choking? My
%%% bet is that there's some sort of conditioning that has occurred over
%%% his few months of seeing the normal Jackpot cue, such that now he's all
%%% psyched out about it. I'd bet you if you trained a new rare jackpot
%%% simultaneously with the common jackpot, he'd choke for neither.
