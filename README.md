# MonkeysChokeUnderPressure_behavior
Data and analysis scripts for the paper "Monkeys exhibit a paradoxical decrease in performance in high-stakes scenarios", Smoulder, Pavlovsky, Marino et al., 2021 (submitted)

Currently (1/7/21) uploaded are all pre-processed data and analysis + figure generation scripts, run originally in MATLAB r2018a. These are in the "AnalysisAndFigures" directory. 

To be done:
- Upload raw data and preprocessing scripts (esp for failure mode classification)
- Add description for downloading data
- Add description to this readme or some of the scripts of the different failure codes (i.e., -22 = overshoot) and how we combine (i.e., -32 is an overshoot that blew through the target, -22 is one that missed the target, in analyses we combine by changing -32 to -22)
- Add descriptions of directory structure within each directory
- Add general project description at this level
